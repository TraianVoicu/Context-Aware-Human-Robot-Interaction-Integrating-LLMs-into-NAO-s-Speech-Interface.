# Context-Aware-Human-Robot-Interaction-Integrating-LLMs-into-NAO-s-Speech-Interface.
We enhance the NAO humanoid robot by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike fixed commands, NAO can now understand open-ended queries, give context-aware responses, and plan actions. Using fine-tuning, prompt design, and semantic matching, we enable more natural, flexible humanâ€“robot interaction.
